# Fauna-Finder-Project
  In this project, we are making an animal detection interface using faster Faster R-CNN(Regional Convolutional Neural Network). 

  Faster R-CNN is a popular object detection algorithm that is used to detect and locate animals in an image. 
Steps involved in this project:
1. Importing the libraries
2. Loading the dataset images
3. Splitting the dataset
4. Apply the image augmentation
5. Build and run augmentation pipeline
6. Prepare Labels
7. Combine labels and image samples
8. Build Deep Learning using the Functional API
9. Define Loses and Optimizers
10. Train the neural network
11. Making prediction and detection.
