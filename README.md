# Fauna-Finder-Project
  In this project, we are making an animal detection interface using faster Faster R-CNN(Regional Convolutional Neural Network). 

  Faster R-CNN is a popular object detection algorithm that is used to detect and locate animals in an image. 
Steps involved in this project:
1. Importing the libraries
2.
